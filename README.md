# Node.js app with Mocha and Chai tests

This code follows along the tutorial:
http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/testing-in-nodejs--net-35018

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/staeff/nodeack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/staeff/nodeack)

## Notes

Since I created a `package.json` using `npm init` and installed `mocha` and `chai`
as development dependencies, `mocha` was wired up to run with the command

    $ npm test

## ToDo

* More documentation
